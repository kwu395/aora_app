## Description
This is a functioning full-stack mobile application built by following JavaScript Mastery's React Native Youtube tutorial.

This app includes sign in, sign up and upload features, all implemented using Appwrite as the database.

This was an incredibly enjoyable learning experience that helped me understand the fundamentals of React Native. I was amazed at how quickly I could create a full-stack social media app in just a few hours.
